BORAY: An Axisymmetric Ray Tracing Code Supports Both Closed and Open Field Lines Plasmas

(r,phi,z), axisymmetry df0/dphi=0, wave vector (kr,nphi=kphi*r,kz), cold plasma for ray tracing, hot plasma for power absorb.

Input: Br(r,z), Bz(r,z), Bphi(r,z), ns0(r,z), Ts0(r,z); and initial (r,phi,z,nphi,kz).
