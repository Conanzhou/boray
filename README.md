An Axisymmetric Ray Tracing Code Supports Both Closed and Open Field Lines Plasmas

(r,phi,z), axisymmetry df0/dphi=0, wave vector (kr,nphi=kphi*r,kz), cold plasma for ray tracing, hot plasma for power absorb.

Input: Br(r,z), Bz(r,z), Bphi(r,z), ns0(r,z), Ts0(r,z); and initial (r,phi,z,nphi,kz).

Can be used to tokamak, spherical tokamak, FRC, mirror, with either numerical or analytical Solovev equilibrium. For waves including electron cyclotron wave (ECW), lower hybrid wave (LHW), helicon wave, high harmonic fast wave (HHFW), ion cyclotron wave (ICW) and Alfven wave (AW).
